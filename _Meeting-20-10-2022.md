## Meeting wih prof. Muñoz (UnB)

### Remote Lab recommendations:
- Softwares:
  - TeamViewer
  - Chrome Remote Desktop (Windows/Mac)
  - AnyDesk (Linux)
- Interaction with board:
  - **Beginner friendly:** Arduino connected to board I/O pins and a PC, with software (Python) in the PC to interface and simulate stimulus. They did a simple small circuit board with pull-up resistors for the pins.
  - **Advanced:** VIOcore, an IP-core avaliable in Vivado that simulates inputs and captures outputs from the board. Has to be used in Vivado Lab Edition (check info).

### Important points:
- The student must be familiarizer with Vivado, because it’s a hard and clunky software. At least 2 classes about familiarization with the tool.
- The professor should first demonstrate an example to the students while they tag along. After that, they do a harder example on their own.
- The best experiment is one that involves sevseg displays and counters or similar, because encompasses all the subjects.
