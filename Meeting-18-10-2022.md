## Meeting with prof. Hayek

### Professor expectations:

- Define a process, what I think is a good idea to start the study in the lab
- Define the best way how students are going to use the FPGA physically
- Make a “How To” of the software, how to find, download and use. Where to find manuals, information and so on
- Plan roughly the hours or workload for each subject/module/class/topic
- Prof would like me to input my own opinion and experience

### Experiments done previously by the professor:

1. Experiment with ready code, just setup the board, generate and upload bitstream
2. Two experiments with students' own code (jumping LED/shift register), with and without clock divider
3. Counters and sevseg displays (BCD, encoders, decoders, MUX for the anodes)
4. Implementing alarm clock or watch

### Other info

- The boards available are in the labs are Nexys A7
- Prof would like to implement picoblaze/microblaze/embedded project in the end
