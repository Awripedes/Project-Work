### Topics/Classes organization

1. **Broad and few topics (used by the professor):** The module is separated in broad topics that covers many subjects in them. One or two lab experiments per topic to consolidate every subject in a more complex experiment.

2. **“Mini Teaching” (suggested by Victor):** Each topic is small and consists of a class and a simple experiment. The class introduces the concepts in theory, the experiment introduces the implementation.

- **Remote Lab (suggested by Victor):** One or more boards connected to a computer that can be accessed remotely. The computer has a Webcam pointed to the board and stays on the whole time. Students can schedule hours to access the Remote lab.
