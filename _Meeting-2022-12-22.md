## Meeting with prof. Hayek

### Things to do:

- Develop the introduction, writing the objective of the Project Work.

- Write student requirements right before the setup (what subjects they should or shouldn't know, etc). 

- Put resources and references of materials throughout the paper.

- Put my background, experiences, whatever, where it fits.

- If possible, provide source code for each experiment proposed.
