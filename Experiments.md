### Experiments

1. How to setup board, software and hardware. Generate and upload a bitstream of a ready code of a simple example, made by the professor
    1. Familiarization with developing enviroment
    2. Interaction with board IO and constraints
2. Generate and upload bitstream of simple combinational logic examples made by the students (time and clock independent). Compare if synthesis and other steps/behavior happened as predicted by theory and simulations
    1. Truth table circuits, encoders, decoders, LUTs, MUX and DEMUX, etc
    2. Each of this as a simple experiment
3. Generate and upload bistream of simple sequential logic examples made by the students (time and clock dependent. Compare if it behaviors as intended
    1. Counters, clock dividers
    2. “Jumping LED” experiment, without and with a clock divider
4. How to make and use components, meaning, ready HDL files used as part of a project
    1. Control LED brightness with PWM using counters made in previous experiments
5. Interact with sevseg displays
    1. Show numbers or symbols (LUTs)
    2. Count and show numbers (decoders)
    3. Show different numbers in different displays (time multiplexing)
6. Final project (?): Make a watch or an alarm clock
    1. Uses components, reusing code made by the student
    2. Uses counters and clock dividers to count real time
    3. Uses counters, clock dividers and LUTs to operate the sevseg displays
    4. Uses buttons and switch to interact with the user and maybe configure the clock
